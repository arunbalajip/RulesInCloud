# RulesInCloud
Business Rules and Management in the Cloud

# Description
We want to build a business rules creation, management, and serving application in the cloud to decouple the business rules from the application. This would give business users the ability to easily create, and update business rules. Developers can then consume the business for application logic and actions. When a rule changes and is approved no code changes or deployments are necessary, subscribed applications can just start executing the new rules.
